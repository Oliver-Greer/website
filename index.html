                                Thought it was about time I tried my hand at a full-stack React/Typescript App, and it has proved to be a great learning experience.
                                I'm hosting this one in Firebase for the generous free tier, and although I could easily have done my api requests through server side functions,
                                I decided to go with a seperate containerized serverless method instead (for the learning experience). 
                                Because I already chose Firebase for the frontend, Google Cloud Run was the obvious choice. 
                                For the api framework I went with FastAPI because, well, it's fast.
                                I also used this as an opportunity to learn about CI/CD pipelines and proper automated testing, so I incorporated Google Cloud Build 
                                and seperate development/production builds.
                                I still need to integrate Firestore with the app so that the representatives are actually displayed, so right now it's not quite usable.

                                Side note: I found <a href="https://www.roadtoreact.com/">The Road to React</a> to be an incredible learning resource for this, 
                                and I highly suggest it to anyone who wants to start learning React.

                            <b>
                                Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/SebLague/Slime-Simulation">Sebastian Lague's Unity slime mold simulation,</a> 
                                this is an agent-based slime mold simulation written entirely in Javascript.
                                The simulation uses Three js's new compute shader language TSL which relies on relatively new WebGPU features for parallel computation.
                                For this reason I recommend using Chrome's newest version to load it, as some browsers don't natively support WebGPU yet (looking at you Firefox).
                                I also recommend using a computer with a decent graphics card, as even with compute shaders simulating 1 million agents is no joke!

                            <b>
                                I created a neural network from scratch that classifies randomly generated data points using only Java.
                                It's a basic feed-forward network, without any optimizers and only dense fully-connected layers.
                                I used JavaFX to create a simple 3D UI where one can view the training process and modify the network parameters. 
                                My hope is that this helps other people better intuitively understand how different parameters affect the efficacy of network training.
                                To try it out, <a href="/src/NeuralNetwork.jar" download>download the Jar executable</a>, download and install the 
                                <a href="https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/#jdk-21-lts">Liberica Full JDK 21</a> then run <pre><code>java -jar .\NeuralNetwork.jar</code></pre> 
                                in the same directory. Alternatively you can clone my Github repo and run it in IntelliJ IDEA.

                            <b>
                                Like many kids, I first got into programming through my desire to make games. 
                                It was only natural then that as I became more ambitious I would transition from simple pygame scripts to a game engine.
                                This is a project from when I was a teenager that a friend of mine (<a href="https://samleavitt.carrd.co/">who is now an artist</a>) 
                                and I made for a Unity Game Jam. I've lost the source code by now, 
                                but I've included the Windows executable for download <a href="src/UnityPlayer.zip" download>here.</a> It's goofy, but moderately fun even today. 
                                My interests have long moved on from game design, but at the time it was an accessible, satisfying way to learn OOP principles.
