                                this is an agent-based slime mold simulation written entirely in Javascript.
                                The simulation uses Three js's new compute shader language TSL which relies on relatively new WebGPU features for parallel computation.
                                For this reason I recommend using Chrome's newest version to load it, as some browsers don't natively support WebGPU yet (looking at you Firefox).
                                I also recommend using a computer with a decent graphics card, as even with compute shaders simulating 1 million agents isn't a joke!
